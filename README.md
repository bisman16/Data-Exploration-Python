# Data-Exploration-Python
This project uses Python's pandas datframe, ggplot and matplotlib libraries to explore NYC flights data. Some interesting points from the data exploration are given below in Results section. For more detailed analysis and code, please check the Nyc_flights.ipynb.

# Results 
1) histgram of airlines for depature delay

2) on time departure by average minute in delaying

3) on time departure by percentage of non-delays

4) mean and standard deviation of inter arrival time for each airport

5) average weather conditions for these delayed flights at the time of scheduled departure in terms of temperature, humidity, wind speed and precipitation

6) how arrival delay is distributed
