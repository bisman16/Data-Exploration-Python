# Data-Exploration-Python
This project uses Python's pandas datframe, ggplot and matplotlib libraries to explore NYC flights data. Some interesting points from the data exploration are given below in Results section. For more detailed analysis and code, please check the Nyc_flights.ipnyb

We can find some interesting details as below -
plot histogram of airlines for departure delays, Measure on time departure by average minute in delaying, Measure on time departure by percentage of non-delays, 
The data frame should contain the full name of the airport and the average number of flights per day, means of inter-arrival times, and standard deviations of inter-arrival times.
iv. Provide the histogram and density plot of the inter-arrival times for the top five busiest airports in the list provided. All plots should be in the same figure.
What were the average weather conditions for these delayed flights at the time of scheduled departure in terms of temperature, humidity, wind speed and precipitation?
iv. Provide plots of distributions for all these weather variables.
Is there a difference, across airlines, how arrival delay is distributed? Please analyze this using histograms faceted by airlines
